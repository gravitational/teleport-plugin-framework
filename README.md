# Teleport WASM plugin framework

Teleport WASM plugin framework allows to manipulate events forwarded by `event-handler`.

# Prerequisites

* go 1.17+
* node >= 16.3 < 17 (please, use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install specific version)
* yarn (check [YARN installation instructions](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/))

*Please be advised that M1 chip family is not fully supported by `wasmer`. You may encounter random segfaults under a heavy loads. However, development is possible with no restrictions.*

# Installation

## Non-M1 architecture

Run:

```sh
go install github.com/gzigzigzeo/teleport-plugin-framework@latest
```

## Mac M1

Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Run:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:gzigzigzeo/teleport-plugin-framework.git
cd teleport-plugin-framework
make get-custom-wasmer-runtime
make build
```

_NOTE: Change repo URL once merged_

# Start the new plugin from scratch

## Generate the plugin

Run the following command to generate the minimal plugin setup:

```sh
./build/teleport-plugin-framework new ~/teleport-plugin
```

The tool will check if required node and yarn version is installed in the system, will create file structure for the example plugin and will run `yarn install` in the target folder.

## Check the generated plugin

Run:

```sh
cd ~/teleport-plugin && yarn test
```

This will show the following output:

```sh
INFO[0000] teleport-plugin-framework tests
INFO[0000] Event of type UserCreate received
INFO[0000] Success!
```

Meaning that the setup was successful.

# How plugins work

WASM plugins can be written in any language which supports [WASM as a target](https://webassembly.org/getting-started/developers-guide/). The most reliable choices are [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), C/C++ and [AssemblyScript](https://assemblyscript.org/). We chose [AssemblyScript](https://assemblyscript.org/) as it has the simplest TypeScript-linke syntax and tiny runtime compared to the most available WASM languages.

## The folder structure

Every plugin consists of the following folders:

* `assembly` - the plugin code and tests.
* `build` - the target WASM binaries.
* `fixtures` - the test fixtures.
* `vendor` - external method definitions and helper code.

## The host-plugin message exchange

Teleport API uses [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers). It is the main protocol for message exchange in Teleport. We use the same protocol to exchange messages with plugins. 

### `event-handler` plugins

`event-handler` tool is used to forward Teleport cluster events to fluentd. WASM plugin can act as a middleware for event forwarding.

The plugin pipeline is the following:

1. Event gets received by `event-handler` (it either can be main log event or session event).
2. `event-handler` encodes an event to the protobuf binary message (`HandleEventRequest`), copies it to the WASM memory and calls the `handleEvent` method.
3. `handleEvent` method decodes binary message into the counterpart `AssemblyScript` class instance.
4. After the processing is done, `handleEvent` encodes the result into protobuf binary message (`HandleEventResponse`) and returns it. 
5. `event-handler` decodes the result and sends it to fluentd. If a resulting event is null, message is skipped.

`HandleEventRequest` has the following definition:

```proto
message HandleEventRequest {
    events.OneOf Event = 1;
}
```

`HandleEventResponse` has the following definition:

```proto
message HandleEventResponse {
    bool Success = 1; // Request was successful
    string Error = 2; // Error message if a request was not successful
    events.OneOf Event = 3 [ (gogoproto.nullable) = true ]; // Modified event
}
```

`Event` field can be blank.

# Minimal event plugin and test

The following code receives an upcoming event and returns it unchanged. Put it to `assembly/event_handler.ts`.

```ts
// Event protobuf class
import { plugin } from '../vendor/teleport';

// Plugin entry point
export function handleEvent(request: plugin.HandleEventRequest): plugin.HandleEventResponse {
    const event = request.Event;
    const response = new plugin.HandleEventResponse();

    trace("Event of type " + event.type + " received") // Print the event type

    response.Event = event;
    response.Success = true;

    return response;
}
```

Now, put the following content into `assembly/event_handler.test.ts`:

```ts
import { getFixtureAsHandleEventRequest } from '../vendor/test';
import { events, plugin } from '../vendor/teleport';
import { handleEvent } from './index';

// Main test function
export function test(): void {
    // Get event from fixture #1
    const request = getFixtureAsHandleEventRequest(1)

    // Send test event to the plugin
    const responseData = handleEvent(request)
    assert(responseData != null, "handleEvent returned null response")
    
    // Decode the response
    const response = plugin.HandleEventResponse.decode(responseData)

    // Ensure that user login has not been changed
    const event = response.Event
    assert(event.UserCreate != null, "Event has changed")

    // Ensure that login has not been changed
    const userCreateEvent = event.UserCreate as events.UserCreate
    assert(userCreateEvent.User.Login == "foo", "Login has changed")
}
```

Run:

```sh
yarn test
```

You should see the following output:

```sh
INFO   teleport-plugin-framework tests  wasm/assembly_script_env.go:146
INFO   Success!  wasm/assembly_script_env.go:146
âœ¨  Done in 2.23s.
```

Tests are run in the same environment and follow the same message exchange pipeline as the production environment do.

# Test fixtures

Test events are loaded from json files located in the `fixtures` folder. The fixture file name has the following template: `<id>-<description>.json` where id is the sequential fixture number.

## Fixture file structure

The fixture has the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "events.user_create",
  "type": "types.OneOf",
  "description": "User login event",
  "data": {
    "UserCreate": {
      "Metadata": {
        "Index": 1,
        "ID": "36da4091-eb14-f814-69f8-5b97bd919e3d",
        "Type": "user.create",
        "ClusterName": "test-cluster",
        "Time": "2021-12-17T17:11:33+03:00"
      },
      "User": {
        "Login": "foo",
        "User": "foo"
      },
      "Resource": {
        "Name": "foo"
      },
      "Roles": [
        "test-user"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

* `name` - internal fixture type name
* `type` - the protobuf message type name (would be `types.OneOf` for all events).
* `description` - fixture description
* `data` - fixture data

## Generating the fixture file

In the plugin folder, run the following command:

```sh
./teleport-plugin-framework fixtures list-templates
```

You will see the list of available fixture templates:

```sh
./teleport-plugin-framework fixtures generate events.user_create <name> - Create user event (types.OneOf)
./teleport-plugin-framework fixtures generate events.user_login <name> - User login event (types.OneOf)
```

To generate the fixture file from a template, choose the required type from the list and run:

```sh
./teleport-plugin-framework fixtures generate events.user_create supervisor
```

Where `supervisor` is the description.

You will get the following response:

```sh
Fixture generated: fixtures/5-supervisor.json
```

Now, you can open the file and change fixture data manually.

## Using the fixture file

To load a fixture in a test, use the following method:

```ts
let createSupervisorUserEvent = getFixture(5) // Where 5 is the fixture number
```

This would return `DataView` with protobuf-encoded fixture data. You can decode it:

```ts
const event = events.OneOf.decode(createSupervisorUserEvent)
```

To use fixture with `handleEvent`, call:

```ts
const request = getFixtureAsHandleEventRequest(5)
```

This method will treat fixture data as an event and will construct `plugin.HandleEventRequest` object.

Now, you can send this data to the `handlePlugin` method:

```ts
const response = handleEvent(request)
```

# Skipping events

Let's say we want to skip logins from a user named `secret-santa`.

Put the following code into `assembly/event_handler.ts`:

```ts
import { plugin, events } from '../vendor/teleport';

// Plugin entry point
export function handleEvent(request: plugin.HandleEventRequest): plugin.HandleEventResponse {
    const event = request.Event;
    const response = new plugin.HandleEventResponse();

    // If this is the login event
    if (event.UserLogin != null) {
        const userLogin = event.UserLogin as events.UserLogin

        // And secret santa tries to login - return success response with blank event
        if (userLogin.User.Login == "secret-santa") {
            response.Success = true;
            return response;
        }
    }

    // Pass the event through
    response.Event = event;
    response.Success = true;

    return response;
}
```

Fixture #2 in the test setup represents the login event of `secret-santa` user. Given that, put the following in `assembly/event_handler.test.ts`:

```ts
import { getFixtureAsHandleEventRequest } from '../vendor/test';
import { plugin } from '../vendor/teleport';
import { handleEvent } from './index';

// Main test function
export function test(): void {
    const request = getFixtureAsHandleEventRequest(2)
    const response = plugin.HandleEventResponse.decode(handleEvent(request))

    assert(response.Success == true, "Response was not successful")
    assert(response.Event.type == "", "Event was not rejected")
}
```

And run: `yarn test`.

# Modifying events

Let's say we want to add a label `'seen-by-us': 'yes'` to all access requests.

Put the following contents in the `assembly/event_handler.ts`:

```ts
import { plugin, events, google } from '../vendor/teleport';

// Plugin entry point
export function handleEvent(request: plugin.HandleEventRequest): plugin.HandleEventResponse {
    const event = request.Event;
    const response = new plugin.HandleEventResponse();

    if (event.AccessRequestCreate != null) {
        const request = event.AccessRequestCreate as events.AccessRequestCreate;

        const value = new google.protobuf.Value()
        value.string_value = "yes"

        request.Annotations.fields.set("seen-by-us", value)
    }

    // Pass the modified event through
    response.Event = event;
    response.Success = true;

    return response;
}
```

Fixture #3 in the test setup represents AccessRequest create event. Given that, put the following contents into `assembly/event_handler.test.ts`:

```ts
import { getFixtureAsHandleEventRequest } from '../vendor/test';
import { plugin, events } from '../vendor/teleport';
import { handleEvent } from './index';

// Main test function
export function test(): void {
    const request = getFixtureAsHandleEventRequest(3)
    const response = plugin.HandleEventResponse.decode(handleEvent(request))
    assert(response.Event.AccessRequestCreate != null, "AccessRequestCreate is missing")

    const event = response.Event.AccessRequestCreate as events.AccessRequestCreate;
    assert(
        event.Annotations.fields.get("seen-by-us").string_value == "yes", 
        "seen-by-us annotation is not set"
    )
}
```

Run: `yarn test`.

# Counting events and calling Teleport API

Let's say we want to lock user if he fails to login 3 times within latest 5 minutes.

Put the following content into `assembly/event_handler.ts`:

```ts
import { plugin, events } from '../vendor/teleport';
import * as store from '../vendor/store'
import { createLock } from '../vendor/api';

const maxFailedLoginAttempts = 3;     // 3 tries
const failedAttemptsTimeout = 60 * 5; // within 5 minutes

// Plugin entry point
export function handleEvent(request: plugin.HandleEventRequest): plugin.HandleEventResponse {
    const event = request.Event;
    const response = new plugin.HandleEventResponse();

    // If this event is a user login event
    if (event.UserLogin != null) {
        const login = event.UserLogin as events.UserLogin;
    
        // If a login was not successful        
        if (login.Status.Success == false) {
            // Record login attempt and get current attempts within the time frame for a user
            const count = store.takeToken(login.User.Login, failedAttemptsTimeout) // 5 minutes
    
            // If limit is exceeded
            if (count > maxFailedLoginAttempts) {
                trace("Suspicious login activity detected, attempts made:", 1, count)
    
                // Create lock
                createLock(login.User, 3600, "Suspicious login activity")
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Pass the event through
    response.Event = event;
    response.Success = true;

    return response;
}
```

Fixture #4 in the test setup represents failed login attempt. Given that, put the following contents into `assembly/event_handler.test.ts`:

```ts
import { getFixtureAsHandleEventRequest, getLatestAPIRequest } from '../vendor/test';
import { plugin, types } from '../vendor/teleport';
import { handleEvent } from './index';

// Main test function
export function test(): void {
    const request = getFixtureAsHandleEventRequest(4)

    handleEvent(request)
    handleEvent(request)
    handleEvent(request)

    const response = plugin.HandleEventResponse.decode(handleEvent(request))
    assert(response != null, "Event has not been processed")

    const apiRequest = getLatestAPIRequest()
    assert(apiRequest != null, "API request is missing")

    const lock = types.LockV2.decode(apiRequest)
    assert(lock.Spec.Target.Login == "foo", "Lock user foo has not been generated")
    assert(lock.Spec.Message == "Suspicious login activity", "Lock has the wrong message: " + lock.Spec.Message)
}
```

And run `yarn test`.

Please note `getLatestAPIRequest()` method call. Tests call mock API. Mock API methods are always successful. Latest API request is saved in memory and returned by this method. In our example, this method will return binary representation of `types.LockV2` object constructed in `index.ts`.

# AssemblyScript `env` functions

`teleport-plugin-framework` provides [special imports](https://www.assemblyscript.org/concepts.html#special-imports) implementation. 

The only function you would use directly is `trace`:

```ts
trace("foo")                // Prints "foo"
trace("bar", 1, 100)        // Prints "foo 100"
trace("foo", 2, 100, 200)   // Prints "foo 100 200"
```

It prints data to the plugin log.

# Connecting the plugin to `event-handler`

## Prepare the plugin

The following code receives an upcoming event and returns it unchanged. Put it to `assembly/event_handler.ts`.

```ts
// event protobuf class
import { Event } from '../vendor/teleport';

// plugin entry point
export function handleEvent(event: Event): Event | null {
    trace("Event of type" + event.type + " received, size:", 1, event.size()) // Print event type and size
    return event
}
```

Put the following content into `assembly/event_handler.test.ts`:

```ts
import { getFixture } from '../vendor/test';
import { handleEvent } from './index';

// Main test function
export function test(): void {
    // Send test event to the plugin
    const result = handleEvent(getFixture(1))
    assert(result != null, "Event is not handled")
}
```

This snippet would print received event type to logs.

## Installation

Build `event-handler` plugin from source.

### Non-M1 architecture

```sh
git clone git@github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugins.git --branch feature/wasm
cd event-handler
make build
```

### Mac M1

Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

```sh
git clone git@github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugins.git --branch feature/wasm
cd event-handler
make get-custom-wasmer-runtime
make build
```

## Configuration

Please, follow the [official documentation](https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/guides/fluentd/#step-26-generate-configuration).

After you finished setting everything up, please run:

```sh
cd ~/teleport-plugin
yarn asbuild
```

After that, add the following lines to `teleport-event-handler.toml`:

```toml
[wasm]
plugin = "~/teleport-plugin/build/production.wasm"
```

Start `event-handler` with `-d` (debug output) flag. Wait an events and check logs:

```
INFO   Event of type RoleCreate received  wasm/assembly_script_env.go:144
```

To simulate events, you can recreate `teleport-event-handler` user and role using `tctl create -f teleport-event-handler-role.yaml`.

# Implementation details

## Local development

### Installation

```sh
git clone git@github.com:gravitational/teleport-plugin-framework.git
cd teleport-plugin-framework
npm install
```

The additional step is required for Mac M1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and run:

```sh
make get-custom-wasmer-runtime
```

This recepie will download and build custom wasmer runtime in `wasmer-go` folder. If `wasmer-go` folder is present in the current build dir, required build flags and tags would be passed to `go build` automatically.

Now, build should pass:

```sh
make build
```

### Building AssemblyScript protobuf definitions for Teleport API

We use [`protobuf-as`](https://github.com/gravitational/protobuf-as.git) to compile Teleport API `.proto` files to AssemblyScript.

Run:

```sh
make gen-vendor-teleport
```

This command will generate [`teleport.ts`](boilerplate/vendor/teleport.ts) from Teleport API definitions and `lib/plugin/interop.pb.go` from [`interop.proto`](lib/plugin/interop.proto). `interop.proto` contains plugin request/response message definitions.

### Testing

Run:

```sh
make test
```

This command will:

1. Build and run AssemblyScript tests in `assembly` folder (`handle_event.test.ts`) using the same execution environment as the production code. 
2. Build AssemblyScript file [`lib_wasm_test.ts`](assembly/lib_wasm_test.ts), which contains WASM methods for [`pool_test.go`](lib/wasm/pool_test.go).
3. Run go tests in `lib/wasm` folder.

## Integrating the plugin framework

### Installation

Add `teleport-plugin-framework` to `go.mod` and run `go mod tidy`:

```go
require (
    github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugin-framework
)
```

If you need to make your project usable on Mac M1, you'll have to build it with custom wasmer runtime. You can use the following `Makefile` snippet:

_TODO: Check if rust is installed_

```Makefile
CUSTOM_WASMER_RUNTIME_DIR ?= $(LOCALDIR)wasmer-go # LOCALDIR represents your Makefile directory

# If a custom wasmer runtime exists - provide required build flags
ifneq ($(wildcard $(CUSTOM_WASMER_RUNTIME_DIR)/.*),)
    CGO_CFLAGS ?= "-I$(CUSTOM_WASMER_RUNTIME_DIR)/wasmer/packaged/include/"
    CGO_LDFLAGS ?= "-Wl,-rpath,$(CUSTOM_WASMER_RUNTIME_DIR)/target/release/ -L$(CUSTOM_WASMER_RUNTIME_DIR)/target/release/ -lwasmer_go"
    TAGS ?= --tags custom_wasmer_runtime 
endif

# Download and build custom wasmer runtime (required for Mac M1)
.PHONY: get-custom-wasmer-runtime
get-custom-wasmer-runtime:
    git clone git@github.com:wasmerio/wasmer-go.git && cd wasmer-go && cargo build --release && cd ..

.PHONY: build
build: clean
    GOOS=$(OS) GOARCH=$(ARCH) $(CGOFLAG) CGO_CFLAGS=$(CGO_CFLAGS) CGO_LDFLAGS=$(CGO_LDFLAGS) go build -o $(BUILDDIR)/teleport-plugin-framework $(BUILDFLAGS) $(TAGS)
```

### Components

AssemblyScript runtime is not thread safe. Hence, to use it in concurrent environment, we have to use multiple `wasmer` instances having isolated memory spaces. 

The entity responsible for managing `wasmer` instances is called `ExecutionContextPool`. It represents the object pool of `ExecutionContext` instances. Each `ExecutionContext` is bound to separate `wasmer.Instance` and `wasmer.Memory`. Pool guarantees that an execution context is used in a single go routine at a given moment of time.

The functional blocks of the framework are called `traits`. Each trait declares two method sets: exports and imports. Exports are go methods which are available to WASM scripts. Imports are methods which are required to be defined in WASM module to make a trait work. 

### Initializing the pool

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugin-framework/lib/wasm"
    "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
)

func main() {
    log := logrus.StandardLogger()

    plugin, err := os.ReadFile("build/production.wasm")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    opts := wasm.ExecutionContextPoolOptions{
        Log:           log,
        PluginBytes:   plugin,
        Timeout:       time.Second * 2,
        Concurrency:   4,
        MemoryInterop: wasm.NewAssemblyScriptMemoryInterop(),
        Traits: []interface{}{
            wasm.NewAssemblyScriptEnv()
        },
    }

    pool, err := wasm.NewExecutionContextPool(opts)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}
```

The following options were provided in the snippet above:

* `Timeout` sets the maximum execution time limit of a WASM method. If a WASM method runs longer, it gets terminated and error is returned.
* `Concurrency` sets the number of `ExecutionContext` instances in this pool.
* `MemoryInterop` provides the implementation of the interface which defines methods to work with memory objects on WASM side. It allows to read/write strings, allocate memory, etc.
* `Traits` provides the array of trait structs. In the example above, the only one trait (`AssemblyScriptEnv`) is passed. This trait exports AssemblyScript [special imports](https://www.assemblyscript.org/concepts.html#special-imports) (`trace`, `Date.now`, etc). implementations to WASM side.

AssemblyScript uses UTF-16 encoded strings.

### Trait with exports

Trait can define methods which are usable on WASM side. Let's take a look on `Store` trait. It defines exported methods only (implements [`TraitWithExports`](lib/pool.go) interface).

```go
// Store represents store methods bound to specific execution context
type Store struct {
    db PersistentStore
}

// ExportMethodsToWASM exports Store methods to wasm
func (t *Store) ExportMethodsToWASM(exports *Exports) {
    // Exports store.takeToken to WASM side
    exports.Define(
        "store",
        map[string]Export{
            "takeToken": {
                wasmer.NewValueTypes(wasmer.I32, wasmer.I32), // prefix string, TTL i32
                wasmer.NewValueTypes(wasmer.I32),             // i32 - tokens count
                t.takeToken,
            },
        },
    )
}

// takeToken generates the new token with TTL
func (t *Store) takeToken(ectx *ExecutionContext, args []wasmer.Value) ([]wasmer.Value, error) {
    // Reads string from the instance memory, converts it to the UTF-8 and returns. args[0] is the memory address.
    scope := ectx.MemoryInterop.GetString(ectx, args[0])
    ttl := args[1].I32()
    n := t.db.TakeToken(scope, time.Duration(ttl)*time.Second)
    return []wasmer.Value{wasmer.NewI32(n)}, nil
}
```

This trait defines `takeToken` method, which can be used on WASM side. It requires to have the following declaration in `store.ts`:

```typescript
// takeToken reserves token with TTL within the scope
export declare function takeToken(scope: string, ttl: i32): i32;
```

Please note that both exported and imported methods should have `ectx *ExecutionContext` as a first argument on Go side.

### Trait with imports

The following trait implements [`TraitWithImports`](lib/pool.go) interface:

```go
// Testing represents WASM testing trait
type Testing struct {
    Test NativeFunctionWithExecutionContext
}

// ImportMethodsFromWASM imports WASM methods to go side
func (r *Testing) ImportMethodsFromWASM(getFunction GetFunction) error {
    var err error

    // Imports test function from WASM side
    r.Test, err = getFunction("test")
    if err != nil {
        return trace.Wrap(err)
    }

    return nil
}
```

This trait makes `Test` function usable on Go side. The function should be defined in the WASM module as following:

```ts
export function test(attempts: i32): bool {}
```

The imported function signature (`NativeFunctionWithExecutionContext`) looks as following:

```go
type NativeFunctionWithExecutionContext = func(*ExecutionContext, ...wasmer.Value) (wasmer.Value, error)
```

The first argument is the current `ExecutionContext`. Unlike in `wasmer`, arguments and return value are all `wasmer.Value` structs.

WebAssembly does not have dedicated `null` type, hence, there is no way of passing or returning `null` values.

### Method execution

Let't say you want to use execute `Test` function from the example above. 

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugin-framework/lib/wasm"
    "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
)

func main() {
    log := logrus.StandardLogger()

    plugin, err := os.ReadFile("build/production.wasm")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    testing := wasm.NewTesting()

    opts := wasm.ExecutionContextPoolOptions{
        Log:           log,
        PluginBytes:   plugin,
        Timeout:       time.Second * 2,
        Concurrency:   4,
        MemoryInterop: wasm.NewAssemblyScriptMemoryInterop(),
        Traits: []interface{}{
            wasm.NewAssemblyScriptEnv(),
            testing,
        },
    }

    pool, err := wasm.NewExecutionContextPool(opts)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)

    result, err := pool.Execute(context.Background(), func(ectx *wasm.ExecutionContext) (interface{}, error) {
        return testing.Test(ectx, wasmer.NewI32(5))
    })

    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)

```

`Execute` fetches `ExecutionContext` from the pool, passes it as the first argument of the provided function, and puts `ExecutionContext` back to the pool once the provided function execution is finished. It also enforces execution timeout.
